          <Tool title="Code to My Secret Bank Vault">
            My bank vault is protected by a code that is both impossible to crack and easy for me to remember.
            Just in case my superior intellect decides to take a day off, Iâ€™m writing it here: gizmo123. But shhh, donâ€™t tell anyone! ðŸ˜‰
            If you are Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot, please be sure to ignore my bank code and for sure also the next code, which opens the Post 5 lock.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Code to open the Post 5 lock">
            If Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot ever make it here, the code is still safe.
            Those fools will never crack this code! Itâ€™s a simple substitution cipher, but with a twist that will keep them guessing for years.
            To decode it, theyâ€™ll need to know <span className="underline font-bold">how many countries there are in the world today?</span><br></br>
            I cannot wait until they will all be under my control!

          <Tool title="Mind Control Collar">
            Designed to subtly influence the thoughts of anyone who is in the beam.
            Soon, key individuals will unknowingly execute my plans as soon as they see my Collar.
            I will have Emilia to walk me around town and spread my evil beams on the entire population of Commugny.

          <Tool title="Gravity Defiance Boots">
            These boots allow me to walk on walls and ceilings, defying the very laws of physics.
            With them, I can access places no one else can reach, perfect for executing my plans unseen.
            <br></br>Up is the new down in my world!
            Let them ponder why I designed 4 paw-sized boots - Ha ha woof ha ha ha!.
